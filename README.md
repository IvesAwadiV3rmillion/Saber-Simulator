# Saber-Simulator
* I'm gonna start development again for this script, just noticed we've almost reached 700k on my pastebin (thank you!)
* V4 is coming real soon, in Mid-August at best.
* V4.0 will include a huge overhaul, fixing performance for certain features & improving the base code base for this script.
# New Features To Expect (V4.0)
- [x] Statistics Menu
- This will include Information about (Player, Boss Stats)
- [ ] Auto-Kill-Players will now have a few more options, like targeting specific players based on several factors.
- [x] Islands Teleporting will now have it's own dropdown, to make it less clutered.
- [x] Improved In-Game Performance when using the script.
- [ ] Add Auto-Equip Best Pets.
- I'll add more to this after a few more updates to something like (Coins, Crowns, Strength)
- [x] Improved Auto-Delete Pets.
- [x] Improved Auto-Buy Features.
- This means the script is gonna make sure you can actually purchase the item before requesting to purchase it.
- [ ] Introduce a change-log system built in the script.
- I already had an idea about this feature, but I never fully implemented it so we'll see how it goes when it's released.
- [ ] Auto-Detect Moderators and leave accordingly.
- Fuck the moderators of this shit game, will be extremely useful when released (this was a request I've gotten in 2020, but never implemented.)
- More coming soon, this isn't all the features V4 is gonna introduce nor fix.
