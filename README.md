# Saber Simulator
* I'm gonna start development again for this script, just noticed we've almost reached 700k on my pastebin (thank you!)
* V4 is coming real soon, in Mid or Late August at best.
* V4.0 will include a huge overhaul, fixing performance for certain features & improving the base code base for this script.
## New Features To Expect (V4.0)
### Home Menu

### Farming Menu
- [x] Auto Swing
